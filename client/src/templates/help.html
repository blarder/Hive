            <h2>Getting Notifications</h2>
            <p>To receive push notifications on your device with the latest shift details,
            select the 'My Devices' tab (by tapping 'Menu', followed by 'My Devices'), and then
            tap 'Register this device'. This will allow temporary staffing to contact you with
            urgent shift updates</p>
            <h2>Booking Shifts</h2>
            <p>After Temporary Staffing contact you to verify your account, you will be able
            to book any available shifts through the 'Shift Calendar' tab. Shifts that are available
            to you will appear as RED boxes. Tapping a box will give you further details, and
            you can apply for a shift by tapping 'Apply'.</p>

            <p>After you do this, the shift box will become ORANGE - this indicates the system is processing
            your request, and validating it to make sure you're eligible. After this process is complete,
            the box will become GREEN if you are successful in your application, or will become RED again
            if your application failed. If you believe there is a mistake and you should be
            eligible for the shift, you can contact Temporary Staffing as usual by phone to book.</p>
